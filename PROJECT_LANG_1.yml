# Start of script
# Project language file 1
# For: seanpm2001/Seanpm2001-Snapcraft
# I chose YAML as the first project language file for this project (seanpm2001/Seanpm2001-Snapcraft) as YAML is already the base language, and first project language for all my snap projects, and that should be reflected here.
# This is an instance in which I am using YAML as a project language file, as I learned how to make the GitHub linguist recognize Markdown as a language, and I extended this to other languages, this time with YAML. I found this out when snooping around on [Apple/Swift Evolution](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/.gitattributes) if you want to do this yourself, simply add this to your `.gitattributes` file (if you haven't created one yet, make it now, do not add anything else to the file name but `.gitattributes`)
gitattributes: ".gitattributes"
